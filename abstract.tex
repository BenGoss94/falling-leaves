\noindent The aim of this project is to research the motion of leaves as they fall, and apply this knowledge to graphical simulations. The main focus is on choosing suitable behaviour and parameters to allow a realistic simulation to be created. \newline \newline
\noindent In order to do this, a system of equations was chosen, and this system tuned to find suitable parameters and initial conditions, through analysis of results of different values. The Jacobian matrix of this system was then evaluated, to allow the stability of equilibria to be found, and the occurrence of bifurcations to be investigated. The equilibrium was found to be a saddle, and there were no bifurcations in the system. \newline \newline
\noindent The next step taken was to create the graphical simulation, allowing for the equations and parameters found to be analysed from a computer graphics perspective, rather than a mathematical one. This was created using the OpenGL C++ Library.
